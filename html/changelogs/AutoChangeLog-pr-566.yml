  - rscadd: "Added options for muzzled, digi and taur alternative icons."
  - tweak: "If no specific icons are given for muzzled, digi and taur alternate_worn_icon, it now defaults to the regular alternate_worn_icon, instead of looking for the sprites in the non-modular icon files with no way to override it."
